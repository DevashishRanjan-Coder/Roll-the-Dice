# Roll The Dice

This project is a dice randomizer. It uses Math.random() generate a random number between 1-6 and then the script takes that number and renders an image based on it. The images are named as dice1 - dice6.png .

This helped me understand and practice how to handle HTML elements/CSS animations with the help of DOM.

The logic is written in javascript, structure is done using HTML and styling is done using CSS.
